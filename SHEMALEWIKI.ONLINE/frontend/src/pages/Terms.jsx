    body: `${company.name} as Data Controller

6.1 Through the Website and Services (including the Account), we process your (special) personal data with your explicit consent, including data about sexual behavior or sexual orientation. We ensure that the processing of this personal data complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable implementation laws. The Privacy Policy published on the Website applies to the processing of this (special) personal data by us as data controller. We advise you to read this Privacy Policy carefully and save it. Your rights regarding the processing of your personal data are also described there.

${company.name} as Data Processor

6.2 If we process personal data of performers affiliated with a Member on behalf of the Advertiser, we process the personal data on behalf of the Advertiser and act as processor, with the Advertiser as the data controller of the personal data of these sex workers, within the meaning of the GDPR. In this case, Articles 6.3 through 6.12 apply.

6.3 We process personal data only if necessary for the fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement with the Advertiser. Other processing will only be carried out after receipt of written instructions from the Advertiser, an order from a court, investigative or other authority, or if a legal obligation exists. We will inform the Advertiser in advance, unless the relevant legal provision does not permit this. We will not retain personal data longer than necessary for the performance of our obligations under the agreement and will delete them afterwards.

6.4 The Advertiser guarantees that the sex worker has given explicit and legally valid consent to process their (special) personal data, including data about sexual behavior or sexual orientation, in an Advertisement or otherwise within the Service. The Advertiser also guarantees that they do not harm the privacy of the sex worker or other third parties and do not act in violation of the GDPR or other applicable laws and regulations.

6.5 The Advertiser indemnifies ${company.name} and holds ${company.name} harmless against all claims, actions, demands from third parties (including sex workers and Visitors) and for any fines and penalty payments from the Data Protection Authority or another supervisory authority resulting from a violation of laws and regulations, in particular the GDPR, or another attributable failure by the Advertiser in fulfilling obligations under these Terms and Conditions.

6.6 We will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure personal data against loss or any form of unlawful processing. These measures guarantee, taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation, an appropriate level of security given the risks that the processing and the nature of the data to be protected entail. The measures are also aimed at preventing unnecessary collection and further processing of personal data.

6.7 Upon written request from the Advertiser, we will (i) provide the Advertiser with information about the processing of personal data, including the security measures we have taken, and/or (ii) grant an accredited auditor engaged by the Advertiser access to our systems so that it can be verified whether we act in accordance with the security obligation laid down in Article 6.6. Such investigation will always take place during normal office hours. The costs of the investigation are borne by the Advertiser.

6.8 We will endeavor to provide reasonable cooperation in carrying out the checks referred to in Article 6.7. In addition, we will provide all reasonable cooperation to the Advertiser in fulfilling their obligation to respond to requests from data subjects regarding the exercise of the rights laid down in the GDPR.

6.9 The Advertiser gives us permission to engage sub-processors for the processing of personal data; these are listed in the Privacy Policy. If we wish to add or change sub-processors, we will inform the Advertiser in advance and allow them to object to the change/addition. We will enter into an agreement with these sub-processors incorporating all relevant obligations from this article and the GDPR.

6.10 We will inform the Advertiser as soon as possible, but in any case at least within 48 hours after we discover a breach or a serious attempt thereto, of breaches of the security measures taken by us or a sub-processor engaged by us, if it can reasonably be assumed that this breach leads to a significant risk of loss or unlawful processing of personal data with adverse consequences for this personal data and the privacy of the data subject. This notification contains relevant information about (i) the nature of the breach, (ii) the identified and presumed consequences of the breach for the processing of personal data, and (iii) the measures that will be taken to end or prevent the breach and to limit the negative consequences of the breach.

6.11 We will maintain confidentiality regarding all personal data that we process in the context of the agreement on behalf of the Advertiser. We will not make personal data available to third parties (other than sub-processors), unless there is an order from a court, investigative or other authority, or we are obliged to do so under relevant laws and regulations or a court ruling.

6.12 We will not process or have processed personal data by ourselves or by sub-processors in countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") without an adequate level of protection, unless we have obtained prior consent from the Advertiser.`,

6.9 El Anunciante nos da permiso para contratar subencargados del tratamiento para el procesamiento de datos personales; estos se enumeran en la Política de Privacidad. Si deseamos agregar o cambiar subencargados, informaremos al Anunciante con antelación y le permitiremos oponerse al cambio/adiciones. Celebraremos un acuerdo con estos subencargados que incorpore todas las obligaciones relevantes de este artículo y el RGPD.

6.10 Informaremos al Anunciante lo antes posible, pero en cualquier caso al menos dentro de las 48 horas posteriores a que descubramos una violación o un intento grave de la misma, de las violaciones de las medidas de seguridad tomadas por nosotros o un subencargado contratado por nosotros, si se puede suponer razonablemente que esta violación conduce a un riesgo significativo de pérdida o tratamiento ilegal de datos personales con consecuencias adversas para estos datos personales y la privacidad del interesado. Esta notificación contiene información relevante sobre (i) la naturaleza de la violación, (ii) las consecuencias identificadas y presuntas de la violación para el tratamiento de los datos personales, y (iii) las medidas que se tomarán para poner fin o prevenir la violación y limitar las consecuencias negativas de la misma.

No pondremos datos personales a disposición de terceros (que no sean subencargados), a menos que exista una orden de un tribunal, autoridad de investigación u otra autoridad, o estemos obligados a hacerlo en virtud de las leyes y regulaciones pertinentes o una sentencia judicial.

6.12 No trataremos ni haremos tratar datos personales por nosotros mismos o por subencargados en países fuera del Espacio Económico Europeo ("EEE") sin un nivel adecuado de protección, a menos que hayamos obtenido el consentimiento previo del Anunciante.`,

6.1 Através do Site e dos Serviços (incluindo a Conta), tratamos os teus dados pessoais (especiais) com o teu consentimento explícito, incluindo dados sobre comportamento sexual ou orientação sexual. Garantimos que o tratamento destes dados pessoais cumpre o Regulamento Geral de Proteção de Dados (RGPD) e as leis de implementação aplicáveis. A Política de Privacidade publicada no Site aplica-se ao tratamento destes dados pessoais (especiais) por nós como responsável pelo tratamento. Aconselhamos-te a ler atentamente esta Política de Privacidade e a guardá-la. Os teus direitos relativamente ao tratamento dos teus dados pessoais também estão aí descritos.

${company.name} como Subcontratante

6.2 Se tratarmos dados pessoais de trabalhadores sexuais afiliados a um Anunciante em nome do Anunciante, tratamos os dados pessoais em nome do Anunciante e atuamos como subcontratante, sendo o Anunciante o responsável pelo tratamento dos dados pessoais destes trabalhadores sexuais, na aceção do RGPD. Neste caso, aplicam-se os Artigos 6.3 a 6.12.

6.3 Tratamos dados pessoais apenas se necessário para o cumprimento das nossas obrigações nos termos do acordo com o Anunciante. Outros tratamentos só serão realizados após receção de instruções escritas do Anunciante, de uma ordem de um tribunal, autoridade de investigação ou outra autoridade, ou se existir uma obrigação legal. Informaremos o Anunciante com antecedência, a menos que a disposição legal pertinente não o permita. Não conservaremos os dados pessoais por mais tempo do que o necessário para o cumprimento das nossas obrigações nos termos do acordo e eliminá-los-emos depois.

6.6 Implementaremos medidas técnicas e organizativas apropriadas para proteger os dados pessoais contra perda ou qualquer forma de tratamento ilegal. Estas medidas garantem, tendo em conta o estado da técnica e os custos de implementação, um nível de segurança apropriado, dados os riscos que o tratamento e a natureza dos dados a proteger implicam. As medidas também se destinam a prevenir a recolha desnecessária e o tratamento posterior de dados pessoais.

6.7 A pedido escrito do Anunciante, (i) forneceremos ao Anunciante informações sobre o tratamento dos dados pessoais, incluindo as medidas de segurança que tomámos, e/ou (ii) concederemos a um auditor acreditado contratado pelo Anunciante acesso aos nossos sistemas para que se possa verificar se atuamos de acordo com a obrigação de segurança estabelecida no Artigo 6.6. Tal investigação terá sempre lugar durante o horário normal de expediente. Os custos da investigação são suportados pelo Anunciante.

6.8 Esforçar-nos-emos por fornecer cooperação razoável na realização dos controlos referidos no Artigo 6.7. Além disso, forneceremos toda a cooperação razoável ao Anunciante no cumprimento da sua obrigação de responder a pedidos dos titulares dos dados relativamente ao exercício dos direitos estabelecidos no RGPD.

Se desejarmos adicionar ou alterar subcontratantes, informaremos o Anunciante com antecedência e permitiremos que se oponha à alteração/adição. Celebraremos um acordo com estes subcontratantes que incorpore todas as obrigações relevantes deste artigo e do RGPD.

6.10 Informaremos o Anunciante o mais rapidamente possível, mas em qualquer caso no prazo máximo de 48 horas após descobrirmos uma violação ou uma tentativa séria da mesma, das violações das medidas de segurança tomadas por nós ou por um subcontratante por nós contratado, se for razoável presumir que esta violação conduz a um risco significativo de perda ou tratamento ilegal de dados pessoais com consequências adversas para estes dados pessoais e para a privacidade do titular dos dados. Esta notificação contém informações relevantes sobre (i) a natureza da violação, (ii) as consequências identificadas e presumidas da violação para o tratamento dos dados pessoais, e (iii) as medidas que serão tomadas para pôr fim ou prevenir a violação e limitar as consequências negativas da mesma.

6.11 Manteremos confidencialidade relativamente a todos os dados pessoais que tratemos no contexto do acordo em nome do Anunciante. Não disponibilizaremos dados pessoais a terceiros (que não sejam subcontratantes), a menos que exista uma ordem de um tribunal, autoridade de investigação ou outra autoridade, ou sejamos obrigados a fazê-lo nos termos das leis e regulamentos pertinentes ou de uma decisão judicial.

6.12 Não trataremos nem mandaremos tratar dados pessoais por nós próprios ou por subcontratantes em países fora do Espaço Económico Europeu ("EEE") sem um nível adequado de proteção, a menos que tenhamos obtido o consentimento prévio do Anunciante.`,
